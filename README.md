# Student and Club Management System


Every year in a University/College, exams and many other events are organized by faculty and/or students. Allocating rooms and seats,
managing the timings and the mass has always been a tedious task. Therefore this project is aimed to reduce a lot of paper work and ease 
the work of the administrative staff/students. The system is a user friendly application that can be used for deciding the seating arrangement 
of all students taking the exam, arranging faculty advisory meetings, check for absent students, a seminar management system and managing 
club activities. The application provides with a simple interface which allows the University to first choose the required service and then 
give input about the type of arrangement required for example for seat allotment, the college can enter details like the number of rooms, 
total capacity, total number of students, total number of faculty, details of student, etc., our system will generate a seating allotment for 
the same along with the invigilators name. Also a similar interface is present for club management system where all the details about the 
clubs/groups of a college can be entered and can be used by the management to keep track about  the clubs and it various activities.
